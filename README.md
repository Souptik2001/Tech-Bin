# Incetivized TEch Bin

## Idea / Approach :-

It mainly consists of a dashboard based webpage which represents percentsge of garbage consumed everyday in the respective categories:
                biodegradable
                non-biodegradable
                e-waste
User will be rewarded on a daily basis and points would be deducted if no waste is collected or not cleared within 24 hours by the waste truck detremined by a feedback. Points will also be deducted if waste of different category is intruduced in a dustbin of a different category. The dashboard will display a statistical analysis of daily and yearly consumption of the different type of wastes consumed by each household. Weight based sensors will collect data and the user will be rewarded say 10 points for every kg and deduction of 5, 6 and 7 points for the aforementioned categories if waste not given to be collected by the waste truck within the 24 hours. Rewards will include several municipal benefits and health benefits for the user by the state government . The data from the dustbins will move to the database of both municipalty servers and user via a WAN system of communication.

## Use Cases :-

* Firstly the model will help in seperation of main three types of wastes (Bio, No-bio & E-Wastes) as throwing them in wrong dustbin will diduct points.
* Next people will not throw wastes here and there and rather they will throw it in their respective dustbins to earn more points.
* Also the problem of rotting of waste and smell problem will also be eliminated as garbage truck will come every 24-hours and if the person does'nt empty his/her dustbin points will be deducted.
